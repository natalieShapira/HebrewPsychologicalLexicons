Word Filtering
A common strategy in preprocessing text data is to remove highly frequent function words
- often referred to as stop words, words that do not add informative value to the words
clusters (topics). We omitted semantically empty words, rare words and uninformative
words. Words were omitted from each document if they corresponded to one or more of
the following 3 conditions:
1. The word is a function word, defined as any word whose POS is not a noun, verb,
adjective, or adverb, and hence it does not carry topical semantic information (e.g.,
“the,” “and,” “yes”).
2. The word is a rare word, defined as a one that appears fewer than 10 times over the
whole documents. Multiple appearance of the various rare-words (the “long tail”
effect), can harm the model’s regularization and lead to poor semantic-interpretable
topics outcome.
3. The word is a common word, defined as a one that appears in more than 90% of
the documents. High-frequency words are subsumed by most topics and thus detract
from the richness of the meaning of the topics.
